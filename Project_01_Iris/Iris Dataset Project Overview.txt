Iris Dataset Project

The Iris dataset's overall presentation was revolving around the idea of Understanding the analysis done so far on the dataset and sharing it with the session.
The phases of analysis consisted of 5 phases:-
1.EDA
2.Feature Engineering
3.Train Test Split
4.Model Building
5.Evaluation and Result

EDA:
    In EDA the basis analysis for understanding the data to support the future analyses was done.
    Namely, describe(),head(),info(),plotting a histogram etc were few of the commands performed to know the dataset initially.

Feature Engineering:
    As far as I could understand, there was the conversion of SepalLength from Cm to M by dividing it from 100.
    Additionally an extra column was also added for he same.

Train Test Split:
    In the phase of train test split, the data was split into some portion of size such that one major part would be used up for
    training the data and the minority of part would be used to test the data.
    This was done to achieve better utility in understanding while dealing with uncertain data in future

Model Building:
     In model building, a model named RandomForestClassifier was introduced and split with random_sample=42 to set the data accordingly.
     In my understanding, this model builds sub decision trees that further trains the model.
     One such example used was CROSS VALIDATION, is which the data was split further in to 5 more sub sets. Each of these subsets were 
     trained and tested, yielding 5 different outputs from each set.

Evaluation and Result:
     In evaluation, the overall performance of the dataset was checked for it's credibility and the result was printed in the form of Accuracy.
